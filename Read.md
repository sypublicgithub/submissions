# Summary

- The aim of this task is to build a simple API (backed by any kind of database). 
- The application should be able to store weather forecast data in the database, based on provided latitude and longitude 
- you can use https://open-meteo.com/ to get a weather forecast. 
- The API should be able to add (new longitude and latitude), delete or provide weather forecast (get a forecast?). 
- It should also provide an endpoint to list previously used longitudes and latitudes from the database, and choose them to provide the newest weather forecast. 

Application specification

  It should be a RESTful API

  You can use https://open-meteo.com  for the weather forecast

  The application can be built in .net framework 4.8 or .net 7

  Usage of any free library which will help implement solution is acceptable (e.g. swagger)

  It is preferable that the API operates using JSON (for both input and output)

  The solution should also include base specs/tests coverage

# setup sqlite db
```cmd
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```
